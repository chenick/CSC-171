CLASS: CSC171 FALL 2013
ASSIGNMENT NUMBER: 3

The assignment of Lab 3 required knowledge on how classes, objects and instance variables relate to one another. Accessor and mutator methods were required in creating multiple instance variables, of string and numeric varieties. A separate test file with a main method was required, in order to see how it can interact with the original file.

This code can be run in Eclipse, where it was written, or in another similar program which is able to compile Java code.
