NAME: Charles Henick
CLASS: CSC171 FALL 2013
ASSIGNMENT NUMBER: 7

The assignment of Lab 7 required knowledge of primitive graphics operations, such as drawRect, fillRect, drawOval, drawLine, and drawString. I drew a football field to practice these operations, as well as explore the available font options in Java.

This code can be run in Eclipse, where it was written, or in another similar program which is able to compile Java code. A kink occasionally occurs where the window of the drawing appears blank initially, but once resized (even slightly), what was drawn appears.
