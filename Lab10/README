ASSIGNMENT NUMBER: 10

Lab 10 required knowledge of methods, and further explored the utilization of loops and conditional statements in returning a specific data type. Arrays were introduced in order to print out the reverse of a number input. In this method, after the input integer is converted to a string, a for loop stores each character in the string in an array, whose elements can then be concatenated in reverse order.

This code can be run in Eclipse, where it was written, or in another similar program which is able to compile Java code.
