ASSIGNMENT NUMBER: 16

Lab 16 introduces the concept of layouts, working with Flow Layouts, Grid Layouts, and Border Layouts. Each layout was created to include 4 or 5 buttons, in order to see how the layout actually works. A fourth layout was created where, in the place of buttons, the previous three layouts were constructed but unfortunately I could not figure out how to debug the error.

This code can be run in Eclipse, where it was written, or in another similar program which is able to compile Java code.

Sources: The textbook and Oracle Javadocs were extremely helpful
