ASSIGNMENT NUMBER: 13

Lab 13 enhanced knowledge of arrays, by working with two dimensional arrays. Addition and subtraction functions were created for two dimensional arrays, with a challenging feature of working for triangle arraysâ€”with a different number of columns in each row. A function that fills each entry in an array with the same integer was also created, using nested for loops.

This code can be run in Eclipse, where it was written, or in another similar program which is able to compile Java code.
