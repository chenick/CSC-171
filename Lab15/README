ASSIGNMENT NUMBER: 15

Lab 15 introduced the concept of File I/O in Java, and its applications. The user is queried for the name of a file 2 different ways, depending on the main method used â€”- via a dialog box through JFileChooser or simply the command line. Another method creates a string of 3 random characters, while another prints it out into the file. Another method reads the content of a file, and squares the random number in each line following the random string.

This code can be run in Eclipse, where it was written, or in another similar program which is able to compile Java code. Due to there being 2 main methods, 1 is commented out in order for the program to run.
