ASSIGNMENT NUMBER: 8

The assignment of Lab 8 required knowledge of do-while loops, in order to calculate the maximum, minimum, and average of a list of integers entered. The difference between long and integer types was also discussed in the calculation of factorials, where the difference in type directly effects until what number a factorial can be correctly calculated. For the last section, use with a JFrame and JPanel were practiced, drawing a Cartesian plane that draws its variables from getWidth() and getHeight() in order to automatically resize when the window is resized by the user.

This code can be run in Eclipse, where it was written, or in another similar program which is able to compile Java code. Occasionally, there is a kink where the user must resize the window (even just a little bit), to see what was drawn.
